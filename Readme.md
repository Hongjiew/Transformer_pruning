#### Zero-TPrune: Zero-Shot Token Pruning Leveraging the Attention Probability in Pre-trained Transformers

**Final Project for COS598D**

"DynamicViT" branch is modified based on its [official implementation](https://github.com/raoyongming/DynamicViT)

Experiment results of GFLOPs and accuracy can be found in `notebook/gflops.ipynb`

Pruning configurations can also be set there
